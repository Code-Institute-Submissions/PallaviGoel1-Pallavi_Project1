		Hiranyakashipu was a king in ancient India who was like a demon. He wanted to take revenge for the death of 
        his younger brother who was killed by Lord Vishnu. So to gain power, 
        the king prayed for years. He was finally granted a boon. But with 
        this Hiranyakashipu started considering himself God and asked his 
        people to worship him like God. The cruel king has a young 
        son named Prahalad, who was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. 
        Prahalad had never obeyed his father’s order and kept on 
        worshiping Lord Vishnu. The King was so hard hearted and 
        decided to kill his own son, because he refused to worship him.
        He asked his sister ‘Holika’, who was immune to fire, 
        to sit on a pyre of fire with Prahalad in her lap. 
        Their plan was to burn Prahalad. But their plan did not go 
        through as Prahalad who was reciting the name of Lord Vishnu 
        throughout was safe, but Holika got burnt to ashes. 
        The defeat of Holika signifies the burning of all that is bad. 
        After this, Lord Vishnu killed Hiranyakashipu. But it is actually
         the death of Holika that is associated with Holi. Because of 
         this, in some states of India like Bihar, a pyre in the form 
         of bonfire is lit on the day before Holi day to remember the 
         death of evil.

			The Holi Festival is that of Radha 
            and Krishna. As the eighth incarnation of the Hindu god 
            Vishna, Krishna is seen by many as the supreme god. Krishna 
            is said to have blue skin because as legend has it, he 
            drank poisonous milk from a demon when he was a baby. 
            Krishna fell in love with the goddess Radha, but feared 
            she would not love him because of his blue skin – but Radha 
            allowed Krishna to dye her skin with color, making them a 
            true couple. On Holi, Festival participants apply color to 
            each other’s skin in honor of Krishna and Radha.
